## **TRIGGER DEFINITIONS GLOSSARY**

### **CPI Triggers**
- **"CPI >0.4% MoM"** = Month-over-Month change in Consumer Price Index
  - Example: If September CPI was 3.2% YoY and October comes in at 3.6% YoY, the MoM change is calculated from the actual monthly index change (usually reported as a separate line item)
  - Bloomberg/Reuters will report this as "CPI +0.5% MoM" in headlines
  - **Measurement window**: The instant the 1:30 PM BST release hits (or 12:30 PM/1:30 PM GMT after clock changes)

- **"CPI >3.0% YoY"** = Year-over-Year headline inflation rate

**IMMEDIATE REACTION WINDOW (1:30 PM - 2:30 PM BST):**

**üìä CPI Data Points to Check (released at 1:30:00 PM BST):**
1. **Headline CPI MoM**: ___% (Bloomberg will show this immediately)
2. **Core CPI MoM**: ___% (excludes food/energy)

4. **DXY reaction**: Check DXY at 1:35 PM, 2:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 5:00 PM BST

**TRIGGER MATRIX:**

| CPI Result | DXY Reaction (by 5pm BST) | Action for Friday Orders |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| MoM >0.4% AND YoY >3.0% | DXY drops >1% from Wed close | **SCALE GLD**: Buy additional ¬£2k (from 8% to 10%). Order Friday at open. |
| MoM >0.4% | Any DXY move | **SCALE KMLM**: Buy additional ¬£2k (from 7% to 9%). Order Friday at open. |

**Order Execution Based on Yesterday's CPI:**

- These will execute Monday Oct 27 (T+1)

**‚è∞ 3:00 PM BST** - **CRITICAL: PRE-FOMC POSITIONING DEADLINE**

**REASON**: Oct 28-29 FOMC is Tuesday-Wednesday next week. With T+1 settlement, Friday orders execute Monday, giving you proper positioning for Wednesday's 7:00 PM GMT decision (after UK clock change).

**VIXY PRE-FOMC INCREASE** (if not already done after CPI):

**Current VIX check at 3:00 PM BST:**
- **If VIX < 17.00**: 
  ```
  BUY VIXY: Increase to 5% total (¬£5k)
  If currently at 3% (90 shares @ $33.35 = ¬£3k)
  Need to add ¬£2k more = ~60 additional shares
  Calculate: ¬£2k / (current VIXY price) = shares to buy
  ```

- **If VIX 17-20**: Increase to 4.5% total
- **If VIX > 20**: Hold current position (already elevated)

**Historical Pattern**: VIX typically rises 2-3 days before FOMC meetings. You're front-running this.

**üéØ Friday Orders Summary:**
1. Execute any CPI-triggered changes from Thursday
2. Increase VIXY to 4-5% (executes Monday, in place for Wednesday FOMC)

| **< 50k** (crisis scenario) | DXY volatile | **SCALE DBMF to 12%** + **ADD TLT 5%** + **EXIT UUP**. Full defensive. |

**Specific Calculation:**
- Consensus: 175k jobs
- Actual: 230k jobs (strong surprise)
- DXY jumps from 98.0 to 99.3 by 2:00 PM GMT (+1.3% move)
- **TRIGGER**: NFP >200k ‚úì ‚Üí Plan to buy UUP Monday morning

**‚è∞ 3:00 PM GMT - VIXY Profit-Taking Check:**

- Calculate: Is portfolio up/down vs Oct 20 start?
- Review: DBMF/KMLM performance in volatility week
- Prepare: Next week's major event is Nov 13 CPI (big one!)

### **MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10**

**‚è∞ 2:00 PM GMT** - **CRITICAL: PRE-CPI POSITIONING BEGINS**

  ```
  MAXIMIZE VIXY: Buy to 5% total
  Current: 0-3% ‚Üí Target: 5%
  Add: ¬£2-5k depending on current position
  REASON: VIX extremely suppressed, CPI likely to spike it
  Order today for Tuesday execution = positioned for Wednesday CPI
  ```

- **If VIX 14-17**:
  ```
  SCALE VIXY: Buy to 4%
  Conservative CPI hedge
  ```

- **If VIX > 17**:
  ```

  Vol already elevated
  ```

**Historical Context:**

Friday Dec 5 is NFP (jobs report) at 1:30 PM GMT

**‚è∞ 7:00 PM GMT** - **CRITICAL DECISION DEADLINE FOR NFP VIXY TRADE**

**VIXY End-Game Strategy:**

**Current VIX level at 7:00 PM GMT: ____**

**Option 1: AGGRESSIVE (Recommended if VIX <17)**
```
SCALE VIXY TO 5% BY END OF DAY TUESDAY
Orders execute Wednesday = positioned for Thursday run-up + Friday NFP
Rationale:
- Dec 5 NFP is your last catalyst
- VIX typically rises 1-2 days before NFP
- Thursday orders execute Friday = you MISS the pre-NFP positioning
- This is your last chance for a volatility home run
Target: ¬£5,000 in VIXY (5%)
CRITICAL: Must order by 8:30 PM GMT Tuesday for Wednesday execution
```

**Option 2: MODERATE (if VIX 17-20)**
```
SCALE VIXY TO 3-4%
More conservative NFP hedge
Order Tuesday for Wednesday execution
```

**Option 3: CONSERVATIVE (if VIX >20 or you're ahead in competition)**
```
STAY AT 2% OR ADD TO 3%
Don't risk capital if you're winning
Small hedge only
```

**üéØ Tuesday Evening - Final Strategy Lock:**

- VIXY: 3-5% ‚Üê Should be elevated for Friday NFP
- Others: ____%
- Cash: ____%

**‚è∞ 5:00 PM GMT** - **LAST CHANCE for minor tweaks**

**If you order Wednesday (executes Thursday):**
- You have ONLY Thursday for those positions to move

### **THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4** üî¥ **LAST ORDER DAY**

**‚è∞ 2:30 PM GMT** - **FINAL TRADING DAY OPENS**

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**

- **If VIXY up >20% from Tuesday entry:** Consider taking partial profits

**‚è∞ 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM GMT** - **PROFIT-TAKING DECISION WINDOW**

**End-Game Psychology:**

**Option A: PROFIT-TAKING (Conservative)**
```
IF you're ahead in competition (up >10% since Oct 20):
‚Üí Consider selling 25-50% of winning positions Thursday
‚Üí Lock in gains
‚Üí Reduces Friday volatility risk
‚Üí Orders execute Friday AM (before NFP impact)

Example:
- GLD up 6% since Oct 20? Sell 2% of your 8% position ‚Üí Lock in gains
- VIXY up 15% since Wednesday? Sell 50% ‚Üí Keep half for NFP
- DBMF up 8%? Hold ‚Üí Let it run through Friday
```

**Option B: RIDE OR DIE (Aggressive)**
```
IF you're behind in competition or want to maximize:
‚Üí Hold ALL positions through Friday close
‚Üí Maximize exposure to final day volatility
‚Üí VIXY could spike 30-50% on NFP surprise
‚Üí Risk: Could also lose on adverse moves
```

**‚è∞ 8:00 PM GMT** - **FINAL HOUR**

**Last chance decisions:**

**1. VIXY Profit-Taking:**
```
IF VIXY up >25% since Wednesday:
‚Üí Consider selling 50% to lock gains
‚Üí Order by 8:30 PM GMT for Friday AM execution
‚Üí Keeps half for NFP spike potential

IF VIXY up >40%:
‚Üí Strongly consider selling 75%
‚Üí Take profits, competition ends tomorrow
```

**2. Core Position Trimming:**
```
IF any position up >15% since Oct 20:
‚Üí Consider trimming by 25% to lock gains
‚Üí Especially if it's a larger position (>8%)
```

**3. Final Rebalancing:**
```
Review target allocation:
- Core diversifiers (DBMF, KMLM, GLD): Should be ~25%

## **POST-COMPETITION: DECEMBER 8-10** (For Context Only)

### **Monday, December 8**

**Note:** Competition is over, but these events will validate your end-game strategy

**Friday's orders execute today** (too late to help competition)

---

### **Tuesday, December 9**

**No major events** - Pre-FOMC/CPI quiet period

---

### **Wednesday, December 10** üî¥

**‚è∞ 1:30 PM GMT** - **November CPI**
**‚è∞ 7:00 PM GMT** - **FOMC Meeting Decision**

**This is the "double-catalyst" day your documents warned about**

If you kept VIXY positions through Friday close, this is the event they were positioned for. But competition is over.

**Historical Note:**
- Your documents called this "EXTREME volatility opportunity"
- "Maximize VIXY hedge" was the recommendation
- But with Dec 5 competition end, you likely exited most VIXY
