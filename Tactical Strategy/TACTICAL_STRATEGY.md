## **TRIGGER DEFINITIONS GLOSSARY**

### **CPI Triggers**
- **"CPI >0.4% MoM"** = Month-over-Month change in Consumer Price Index
  - Example: If September CPI was 3.2% YoY and October comes in at 3.6% YoY, the MoM change is calculated from the actual monthly index change (usually reported as a separate line item)
  - Bloomberg/Reuters will report this as "CPI +0.5% MoM" in headlines
  - **Measurement window**: The instant the 1:30 PM BST release hits (or 12:30 PM/1:30 PM GMT after clock changes)

- **"CPI >3.0% YoY"** = Year-over-Year headline inflation rate
  - **Current level**: ~3.0-3.2% (we'll get Oct 24 reading)
  - **Trigger activated**: If headline number is 3.0% or higher

### **DXY (US Dollar Index) Triggers**
- **"DXY drops >1% in one day"**
  - Current DXY: ~97-99
  - **Measurement window**: From 10:00 PM GMT previous day close to 10:00 PM GMT current day close (US market closes 9:00 PM BST / 9:00-10:00 PM GMT UK time)
  - **Calculation**: If DXY closes at 98.0 on Day 1 and closes at 97.0 or lower on Day 2 = 1.02% drop = TRIGGER ACTIVATED
  - Monitor via: Bloomberg ticker DXY, Investing.com Dollar Index

- **"DXY <98"** = Dollar Index trades below 98.00 at any point during trading day
  - Current level: 97-99 range per your documents
  - This is a **level trigger** not a percentage move

- **"DXY >100"** = Dollar Index breaks above 100.00
  - Would be a ~2-3% rally from current levels
  - **Bullish for WisdomTree Short EUR Long USD**

  - Check at: 2:30 PM BST / 2:30 PM GMT market open
  - Current VIX: ~18-21 per recent activity

- **"VIX >30"** = Immediate exit signal
  - Historical context: VIX hit 60 in April 2025, typically sits at 12-20
  - **Action**: Place market sell order for Amundi VIX ETF within 30 minutes of VIX crossing 30

- **"VIX spike >22"** = VIX crosses above 22.00
  - Signals risk-off environment
  - Activates iMGP DBi Managed Futures scaling trigger

### **Oil Price Triggers**
- **"Oil >$85"** = WTI Crude Oil futures sustained above $85/barrel
  - Current price: Check NYMEX WTI front-month contract
  - **"Sustained"** = Closes above $85 for 2 consecutive days
  - Activates WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity entry

### **FOMC Triggers**
- **"Hawkish Fed pivot"** = Dot plot shows median 2026 rate projection increases by 25bps+ vs September
  - Example: If Sept dot plot showed 3.50% for 2026 and Oct shows 3.75%+ = HAWKISH
  - Or: Statement includes "higher for longer" language

- **"Dovish Fed"** = 25bps cut delivered + forward guidance suggests more cuts coming
  - Or: Any 50bps cut
  - **Bearish for WisdomTree Short EUR Long USD, WisdomTree Physical Gold**

### **NFP (Jobs) Triggers**
- **"NFP >200k"** = Non-Farm Payrolls add more than 200,000 jobs
  - Current consensus typically: 150-180k
  - **Measurement**: Headline number at 1:30 PM BST / 12:30 PM or 1:30 PM GMT release

- **"NFP <100k"** = Jobs miss badly, adds fewer than 100,000
  - Signals economic weakness
  - **Bearish for WisdomTree Short EUR Long USD, bullish for iShares Treasury 20+yr**

### **Position Sizing Language**
- **"Scale to X%"** = Increase position from current weight to X%

- **"Deploy cash to X at Y%"** = Use your 7% cash reserve
  - Example: "Deploy cash to WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity at 4%" = Buy ¬£4k from cash holdings

### **THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23** üî¥ **RED ALERT**

**‚è∞ 1:30 PM BST** - **September CPI Release** (delayed from government shutdown)

**IMMEDIATE REACTION WINDOW (1:30 PM - 2:30 PM BST):**

You **CANNOT** act immediately on the data due to T+1 settlement and Dec 4 deadline constraints. However, you can **prepare Friday orders** based on Thursday's data.

**üìä CPI Data Points to Check (released at 1:30:00 PM BST):**
1. **Headline CPI MoM**: ___% (Bloomberg will show this immediately)
2. **Core CPI MoM**: ___% (excludes food/energy)
3. **Headline YoY**: ___% (compare to ~3.0-3.2% expected)
4. **DXY reaction**: Check DXY at 1:35 PM, 2:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 5:00 PM BST

**TRIGGER MATRIX:**

| CPI Result | DXY Reaction (by 5pm BST) | Action for Friday Orders |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| MoM >0.4% AND YoY >3.0% | DXY drops >1% from Wed close | **SCALE GOLD**: Buy additional ¬£2k WisdomTree Physical Gold (from 8% to 10%). Order Friday at open. |
| MoM >0.4% | Any DXY move | **SCALE AQR**: Buy additional ¬£2k AQR Managed Futures (from 7% to 9%). Order Friday at open. |

---

### **FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24**

**‚è∞ 2:00 PM BST** - **EXECUTE THURSDAY'S TRIGGER-BASED ORDERS**

**Order Execution Based on Yesterday's CPI:**
- Review your Thursday evening notes
- Place orders for any triggered scaling/exits
- These will execute Monday Oct 27 (T+1)

**‚è∞ 3:00 PM BST** - **CRITICAL: PRE-FOMC POSITIONING DEADLINE**

**REASON**: Oct 28-29 FOMC is Tuesday-Wednesday next week. With T+1 settlement, Friday orders execute Monday, giving you proper positioning for Wednesday's 7:00 PM GMT decision (after UK clock change).

**Amundi VIX ETF PRE-FOMC INCREASE** (if not already done after CPI):

**Current VIX check at 3:00 PM BST:**
- **If VIX < 17.00**: 
  ```
  BUY Amundi S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF: Increase to 5% total (¬£5k)
  If currently at 3% (¬£3k)
  Need to add ¬£2k more
  Calculate: ¬£2k / (current Amundi VIX ETF price) = amount to buy
  ```

- **If VIX 17-20**: Increase to 4.5% total
- **If VIX > 20**: Hold current position (already elevated)

**Historical Pattern**: VIX typically rises 2-3 days before FOMC meetings. You're front-running this.

**üéØ Friday Orders Summary:**
1. Execute any CPI-triggered changes from Thursday
2. Increase Amundi VIX ETF to 4-5% (executes Monday, in place for Wednesday FOMC)
3. Check gold: if WisdomTree Physical Gold up >5% since Monday, consider taking 2% profit (scale back to 6%)

**Weekend Homework:**
- Monitor geopolitical news (Middle East, China-Taiwan)
- Review FOMC expectations: is 25bps cut still 97% priced in?
- Check if any Fed speakers comment this weekend
- **Remember: Clocks go back Sunday at 2:00 AM BST ‚Üí GMT**

# LIVE UPDATE FRI 19.15 BST
## Revised Critical Market Analysis (6:54 PM BST)

### Key Trigger Assessment

**CPI Results (Released 1:30 PM BST Today)**
- Headline MoM: 0.3% (BELOW 0.4% trigger) ‚ùå[3][4]
- Core MoM: 0.2%[3]
- Headline YoY: 3.0% (AT threshold, not >3.0%) ‚ö†Ô∏è[3]
- **Action: No CPI-triggered scaling required**[3]

**DXY Analysis**
- Oct 23 close: 98.92[5]
- Current: 98.936 (+0.12% in 24hrs)[6]
- **Daily change: +0.04 points = +0.04%** (NOT >1% drop) ‚ùå
- **Action: Gold scaling NOT triggered**

**VIX - CRITICAL CHANGE** ‚úÖ
- Current: **16.44** (down 4.97% today)[7]
- **This is BELOW the 17.00 threshold** for maximum pre-FOMC positioning[2][1]
- FOMC meeting: Tuesday-Wednesday Oct 28-29 (4 days away)[1][2]
- Expected: 25bps cut with 97% probability[2][1]

**Oil & Gold**
- WTI: $61.60/barrel (well below $85 trigger) ‚ùå
- Gold: $4,110/oz (stable after CPI) ‚úì

### Updated Action Required - URGENT (Before 7:00 PM BST Close)

## **PRIMARY ACTION: Increase Amundi VIX ETF to 5% (Maximum Pre-FOMC Position)**

**Current VIX: 16.44 = BELOW 17.00 threshold**

Per your calendar's pre-FOMC positioning rules:[1][2]
> **If VIX < 17.00**: BUY Amundi S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF to 5% total (¬£5k)

**Recommended Order (Place Immediately):**
```
BUY Amundi S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF
Amount: ¬£2,000 (increase from 3% = ¬£3k to 5% = ¬£5k)
Rationale: VIX at 16.44 is near 52-week lows, FOMC in 4 days
Settlement: Monday Oct 27 (T+1)
Target hold: Through Oct 29 FOMC decision (7:00 PM GMT)
Exit window: Oct 30-31 (contango decay risk)
```

**Why This Is Optimal:**
1. **VIX at multi-week low (16.44)**: Minimal downside risk[8][7]
2. **FOMC catalyst in 4 days**: Historical volatility pickup before major Fed meetings[9][8]
3. **Soft CPI reduces immediate vol**: Today's benign inflation data compressed VIX, creating entry opportunity[3]
4. **97% probability of 25bps cut**: High certainty means resolution event will occur[2][1]
5. **Research shows VIX drops AFTER FOMC**: Buying low VIX before event, selling into post-announcement compression[9][8]

## Secondary Actions

### **HOLD All Other Positions**
- **iMGP DBi Managed Futures**: 10% (no scaling trigger)[4]
- **AQR Managed Futures**: 7% (MoM was 0.3%, not >0.4%)[4][3]
- **WisdomTree Physical Gold**: 8% / 358 shares (no DXY drop >1%, no YoY >3.0%)[5][6]
- **Cash**: Will reduce from 7% to 5% (deploying ¬£2k to VIX)

### **DO NOT Enter**
- ‚ùå WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity: Oil at $61.60, need sustained >$85
- ‚ùå WisdomTree Short EUR Long USD: No hawkish trigger yet, await FOMC
- ‚ùå Additional gold: Neither CPI nor DXY triggers activated[6][5][3]

## Next Week's Critical Timeline (All Times in GMT After Clock Change)

### **Sunday, October 26, 2:00 AM**
- **Clocks go back: BST ‚Üí GMT** (lose 1 hour)
- Monitor Sunday evening futures for any gap moves

### **Monday, October 27**
- Verify Amundi VIX ETF order filled at 5% (¬£5k total)
- Check VIX level at US market open (2:30 PM GMT)
- **If VIX >20 by close**: Consider taking partial profits (25-30% of position)

### **Tuesday, October 28 (FOMC Day 1)**
- Monitor VIX behavior into Fed decision
- **Alert thresholds**:
  - VIX >25: Prepare to exit 75%
  - VIX >30: EXIT 100% IMMEDIATELY (non-negotiable)

### **Wednesday, October 29 (FOMC Day 2)**
- **7:00 PM GMT**: FOMC rate decision + statement[1][2]
- **7:30 PM GMT**: Fed Chair press conference

**Immediate Post-FOMC Actions:**
- Monitor VIX reaction (research shows typical drop after FOMC)[8][9]
- **If VIX drops sharply post-decision**: Exit 75-100% of Amundi VIX ETF position Wednesday evening or Thursday morning
- **If VIX spikes >30**: Exit 100% immediately
- **If gain >35-40%**: Exit 100% and take profits

### **Thursday, October 30**
- **Final exit deadline for Amundi VIX ETF** (contango decay accelerates after event)
- Even if showing modest gains, exit to avoid multi-day holding costs
- Redeploy proceeds to cash or other positions

## Risk Management - VIX Position Rules

**HARD STOPS (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **VIX >30**: EXIT 100% within 30 minutes
2. **Gain >40%**: EXIT 100% immediately
3. **Thursday Oct 30**: EXIT 100% by end of day (never hold VIX products >3 days around events)

**Historical Context:**
- VIX typically rises modestly 1-2 days before FOMC, then drops sharply after decision[9][8]
- Research shows "pre-FOMC announcement drift" is accompanied by VIX decline, not increase[8][9]
- Your edge: Buying at 16.44 (very low) with 4-day catalyst, exiting into post-FOMC compression

## Updated Portfolio Allocation (After Tonight's Order)

| Position | Current | After Order | ¬£ Amount |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| iMGP DBi Managed Futures | 10% | 10% | ¬£10,000 |
| AQR Managed Futures | 7% | 7% | ¬£7,000 |
| WisdomTree Physical Gold | 8% | 8% | ¬£8,000 |
| **Amundi VIX ETF** | **3%** | **5%** | **¬£5,000** |
| Cash | 7% | 5% | ¬£5,000 |
| **Total Diversifier** | **35%** | **35%** | **¬£35,000** |

## Weekend Homework

1. **Monitor geopolitical news**: Russia oil sanctions escalating, Ukraine strikes on refineries[10]
2. **Check Sunday futures** (open 10:00 PM GMT): Any VIX gap up would be bonus
3. **Review Fed speaker comments**: Unlikely over weekend but possible
4. **Set Monday alerts**:
   - VIX >20 (profit-taking consideration)
   - VIX >25 (75% exit trigger)
   - VIX >30 (100% exit trigger)
   - Amundi VIX ETF gain >35%

## Summary - Execute NOW (Before 7:00 PM BST)

‚úÖ **BUY ¬£2,000 Amundi VIX ETF** (3% ‚Üí 5%)[2][1]
‚úÖ **HOLD all other positions unchanged**[5][6][3]
‚ùå **DO NOT scale gold, AQR, or enter commodities**[4][3]
‚è∞ **EXIT plan: Oct 30 by latest** (2-3 day maximum hold)[9][8]

**Rationale**: VIX at 16.44 with FOMC in 4 days is your calendar's exact trigger for maximum pre-event positioning. This is a tactical 2-3 day trade, not a strategic hold.[8][1][2]
---

### **SUNDAY, OCTOBER 26** ‚è∞ **CLOCK CHANGE**

**‚è∞ 2:00 AM** - **UK clocks go back 1 hour**
- BST (UTC+1) ‚Üí GMT (UTC+0)

---

### **TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28** üü°

- Your ability to react is LIMITED (T+1 settlement + Dec 4 deadline)
- **Decision**: If you want to exit Amundi VIX ETF post-FOMC, you must place Wednesday orders by 8:30 PM GMT

**‚è∞ 2:00 PM GMT** - Verify Monday's WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity exit (if triggered by China PMI)

**‚è∞ 7:00 PM GMT** - **CRITICAL DECISION DEADLINE FOR NFP AMUNDI VIX ETF TRADE**

**THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POSITION FOR FRIDAY DEC 5 NFP**

**Amundi VIX ETF End-Game Strategy:**

**Current VIX level at 7:00 PM GMT: ____**

**Option 1: AGGRESSIVE (Recommended if VIX <17)**
```
SCALE Amundi S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF TO 5% BY END OF DAY TUESDAY
Orders execute Wednesday = positioned for Thursday run-up + Friday NFP
Rationale:
- Dec 5 NFP is your last catalyst
- VIX typically rises 1-2 days before NFP
- Thursday orders execute Friday = you MISS the pre-NFP positioning
- This is your last chance for a volatility home run
Target: ¬£5,000 in Amundi VIX ETF (5%)
CRITICAL: Must order by 8:30 PM GMT Tuesday for Wednesday execution
```

**Option 2: MODERATE (if VIX 17-20)**
```
SCALE Amundi VIX ETF TO 3-4%
More conservative NFP hedge
Order Tuesday for Wednesday execution
```

**Option 3: CONSERVATIVE (if VIX >20 or you're ahead in competition)**
```
STAY AT 2% OR ADD TO 3%
Don't risk capital if you're winning
Small hedge only
```

**‚è∞ 8:30 PM GMT - TUESDAY FINAL ORDER DEADLINE FOR WEDNESDAY EXECUTION**

**This is effectively your last major positioning move of the competition**

**Orders placed Tuesday ‚Üí Execute Wednesday ‚Üí In place for Thu/Fri**
**Orders placed Wednesday ‚Üí Execute Thursday ‚Üí In place for Fri only**
**Orders placed Thursday ‚Üí Execute Friday ‚Üí You can't react to Friday 1:30 PM GMT NFP**

**üéØ Tuesday Evening - Final Strategy Lock:**

**‚è∞ 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM GMT** - **PROFIT-TAKING DECISION WINDOW**

**End-Game Psychology:**

**Option A: PROFIT-TAKING (Conservative)**
```
IF you're ahead in competition (up >10% since Oct 20):
‚Üí Consider selling 25-50% of winning positions Thursday
‚Üí Lock in gains
‚Üí Reduces Friday volatility risk
‚Üí Orders execute Friday AM (before NFP impact)

Example:
- WisdomTree Physical Gold up 6% since Oct 20? Sell 2% of your 8% position ‚Üí Lock in gains
- Amundi VIX ETF up 15% since Wednesday? Sell 50% ‚Üí Keep half for NFP
- iMGP DBi Managed Futures up 8%? Hold ‚Üí Let it run through Friday
```

**Option B: RIDE OR DIE (Aggressive)**
```
IF you're behind in competition or want to maximize:
‚Üí Hold ALL positions through Friday close
‚Üí Maximize exposure to final day volatility
‚Üí Amundi VIX ETF could spike 30-50% on NFP surprise
‚Üí Risk: Could also lose on adverse moves

‚Üí Keeps half for NFP spike potential

IF Amundi VIX ETF up >40%:
‚Üí Strongly consider selling 75%
‚Üí Take profits, competition ends tomorrow
```

**2. Core Position Trimming:**
```
IF any position up >15% since Oct 20:
‚Üí Consider trimming by 25% to lock gains
‚Üí Especially if it's a larger position (>8%)
```

**3. Final Rebalancing:**
```
Review target allocation:
- Core diversifiers (iMGP, AQR, WisdomTree Physical Gold): Should be ~25%
- Tactical positions (Amundi VIX, WisdomTree Short EUR Long USD, WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity, iShares Treasury 20+yr): Should be ~5-10%
- Cash: Should be ~5%
```
